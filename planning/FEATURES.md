# xSwarm Feature Roadmap

This document outlines planned features for xSwarm, organized by priority and implementation phase.

## Design Philosophy

xSwarm is a **voice-based system assistant** focused on:
- System maintenance and monitoring
- Project tracking across multiple machines
- AI orchestration (Claude Code SDK integration)
- Developer workflow automation
- Hands-free operation while coding

**Not** a CLI tool replacement - xSwarm enhances your workflow through voice interaction and intelligent automation.
