# Root Directory Documentation Cleanup - COMPLETED ✓

## Goal
Clean up the project root directory by moving all implementation summaries and documentation to their proper locations, leaving only essential project files in the root.

## Tasks - ALL COMPLETE ✓

### Phase 1: Move Implementation Summaries to docs/
- [x] Move BUZZ_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md from root to docs/
- [x] Move MARKETING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md from root to docs/
- [x] Move SUGGESTIONS_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md from root to docs/
- [x] Move DASHBOARD_README.md from root to docs/

### Phase 2: Move Quickstart Guides to docs/quickstart/
- [x] Move BUZZ_QUICKSTART.md from root to docs/quickstart/
- [x] Move MARKETING_QUICKSTART.md from root to docs/quickstart/
- [x] Move SUGGESTIONS_QUICKSTART.md from root to docs/quickstart/

### Phase 3: Verify docs/ directory organization
- [x] Confirm all files already in docs/ are properly organized
- [x] No further moves needed for docs/ (files are already there)

### Phase 4: Verify planning/ directory
- [x] Confirm COMPLETE_SPECIFICATION.md is already in planning/
- [x] Confirm SIMPLE_DESIGN.md is already in planning/

### Phase 5: Verify Final Root Directory State
- [x] Verify root only contains essential files (README.md, CLAUDE.md, SECURITY.md, config files)
- [x] Confirm no broken links in documentation
- [x] Create summary document of new file locations (docs/FILE_ORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md)
