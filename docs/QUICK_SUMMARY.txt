DYNAMIC THEME SWITCHING - QUICK SUMMARY
========================================

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE - READY TO TEST

WHAT WAS FIXED:
- Only borders were changing color (text/backgrounds stayed gray)
- Root cause: widgets had hardcoded colors in Rich Text rendering
- Solution: Pass theme palette to widgets, they render with dynamic colors

FILES MODIFIED (in packages/assistant/):
1. assistant/dashboard/app.py - passes theme_colors dict to widgets
2. assistant/dashboard/widgets/activity_feed.py - uses dynamic colors
3. assistant/dashboard/widgets/panels/voice_visualizer_panel.py - uses dynamic colors
4. assistant/dashboard/widgets/status.py - uses dynamic colors

TEST IT:
  xswarm

WHAT TO EXPECT:
- Personas rotate every 5 seconds
- JARVIS: cyan (#00D4FF)
- GLaDOS: orange (#FFA500)
- Borders, text, AND backgrounds change together
- Complete unified theme experience
