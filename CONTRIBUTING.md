## Creating a New Theme

Want to add your favorite AI/robot character? Here's how:

### Step 1: Choose Your Character

Pick an AI/robot character with:
- **Distinct personality** - Clear speech patterns and behaviors
- **Available audio** - Voice clips exist online for training
- **Memorable traits** - Unique phrases, tone, or quirks

**Examples:** WALL-E, EDI (Mass Effect), Cortana (Halo), Baymax (Big Hero 6), Robby the Robot, T-800, Data (Star Trek)

### Step 2: Create Theme Structure

```bash
# Create theme directory (use lowercase with hyphens)
mkdir -p packages/themes/wall-e/{audio/samples,assets}

# Create required files
touch packages/themes/wall-e/theme.yaml
touch packages/themes/wall-e/personality.md
touch packages/themes/wall-e/vocabulary.yaml
touch packages/themes/wall-e/README.md
touch packages/themes/wall-e/audio/SOURCES.md
```

### Step 3: Fill Out Configuration Files

See existing themes in `packages/themes/` for examples. Each theme needs:

- **theme.yaml** - Basic configuration (colors, voice settings, key phrases)
- **personality.md** - Detailed personality guide with DO/DON'T examples
- **vocabulary.yaml** - Speech patterns, greetings, technical terms
- **README.md** - Theme overview and character description
- **audio/SOURCES.md** - Direct URLs for voice training audio

Refer to `hal-9000`, `jarvis`, or `glados` themes as templates.

### Step 4: Gather Audio Sources

Create `audio/SOURCES.md` with direct URLs for voice clips:

```markdown
# CHARACTER Voice Training Sources

**Character:** Character Name from *Source Material* (Year)
**Voice Actor:** Actor Name

## Direct Audio Sources

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXAMPLE1
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXAMPLE2
- https://soundboards.com/character-sounds

## Key Phrases to Capture

- "Iconic quote 1"
- "Iconic quote 2"
- Technical explanations
- Emotional responses

## Target Format

- **Format:** WAV, 24kHz, 16-bit
- **Duration:** 3-10 minutes total
- **Quality:** Clear speech, minimal background noise
- **Clips:** ~10 clips showing different emotions/contexts
```

### Step 5: Create Visual Assets (Optional)

Add a character icon to `assets/icon.svg` (or icon.png):
- Square format (512x512 recommended)
- Transparent background
- Iconic representation of the character

### Step 6: Test Your Theme

```bash
# Build the project
cargo build

# Test theme loading
xswarm config set overlord.theme your-theme-name

# Verify theme configuration
xswarm config show
```

## Training Voice Models

Once your theme structure is complete, train the voice model using collected audio.

### Automated Training (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
brew install ffmpeg yt-dlp  # macOS
# or: sudo pacman -S ffmpeg yt-dlp  # Arch Linux

# Download and convert audio automatically
python scripts/train_voice.py --theme your-theme-name

# Limit to first 5 clips for testing
python scripts/train_voice.py --theme your-theme-name --limit 5
```

The script will:
1. Read URLs from `packages/themes/your-theme-name/audio/SOURCES.md`
2. Download from YouTube or direct links
3. Convert to WAV 24kHz mono
4. Save to `audio/samples/` directory

### Post-Processing

After automated download:

1. **Listen to each clip** - Ensure correct character and quality
2. **Rename descriptively**:
   - `01_source.wav` â†’ `01_greeting.wav`
   - `02_source.wav` â†’ `02_technical.wav`
   - etc.
3. **Edit in Audacity** (optional):
   - Remove long silences (Effect â†’ Truncate Silence)
   - Normalize volume (Effect â†’ Normalize, -3dB)
   - Remove background noise (Effect â†’ Noise Reduction)
4. **Keep 8-10 best clips** - Total 3-10 minutes

### Manual Training (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Download from YouTube
yt-dlp -x --audio-format wav "VIDEO_URL"

# Convert to proper format
ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -acodec pcm_s16le -ar 24000 output.wav

# Edit in Audacity, then export as WAV 24kHz
```

### Train MOSHI Model (Future Feature)

```bash
# Generate voice embedding
xswarm voice train --theme your-theme-name --samples packages/themes/your-theme-name/audio/samples/

# Test voice model
xswarm voice test --theme your-theme-name --text "Hello! Testing voice model."
```
