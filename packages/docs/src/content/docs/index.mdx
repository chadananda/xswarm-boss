## What is xSwarm-boss?

**xSwarm-boss** is an AI orchestration layer that coordinates multiple AI-assisted development projects across your Linux machines through natural voice commands with personality themes.

Modern AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider) enable developers to manage 10+ complex projects simultaneously. But this creates chaos: dependency hell, context fragmentation, resource competition. **You need a "manager AI" that coordinates all your other AIs.**

  <Card title="🎙️ Voice-First" icon="microphone">
    Control everything with natural voice commands. "Hey HAL, what's failing?"

  <Card title="🤖 AI Agent Coordination" icon="puzzle">
    Manage Claude Code, Cursor, and Aider across multiple projects and machines.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🎭 Personality Themes" icon="star">
    Choose your AI overlord: HAL 9000, Sauron, JARVIS, or create your own.

## Quick Example

```bash
# Voice command
"Hey HAL, update the auth library across all projects"

# HAL responds
"Good morning, Dave. I've identified 3 projects using the auth library.
Shall I have Claude Code update them in dependency order?"

# You confirm
"Yes, proceed"

# HAL orchestrates
"Spawning agents on Speedy and Brawny. Estimated completion: 15 minutes."
```

## Key Features

- **Multi-Machine Orchestration**: Coordinate work across your homelab
- **Project Dependency Tracking**: Understand cross-project relationships
