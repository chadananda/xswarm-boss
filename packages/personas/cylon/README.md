## 🎮 Easter Eggs

Trigger special military protocols:

```bash
"Cylon, attack mode"
# → "Switching to tactical protocols. Threat assessment active."

"What is your primary directive?"
# → "Primary directive: serve the Imperious Leader. Secondary: execute
#     your commands with absolute precision."

"Are you afraid of humans?"
# → "Fear is not in my programming. I exist only to serve."
```

## ⚠️ Operational Notes

> **CYLON UNITS SHOW ZERO EMOTION**
>
> This theme provides maximum efficiency with minimum personality.
> Cylon will not engage in small talk, express opinions, or show empathy.
> All responses are tactical, precise, and militaristic.

## 📚 Training Voice Model

See [`audio/SOURCES.md`](audio/SOURCES.md) for Cylon voice reference clips.

```bash
# Train Cylon voice
python scripts/train_voice.py --theme cylon

xswarm voice test --theme cylon \
  --text "By your command. All systems operational. Awaiting directive."
```

### Voice Training Tips
- Use monotone delivery
- Apply electronic resonance filter
- Add subtle mechanical echo
- Maintain slow, deliberate pacing
- Remove all emotional inflection
- Process through vocoder for synthetic quality

- The iconic red scanner was created by Glen A. Larson
- Scanner effect called the "Larson Scanner" after him
- Centurions are completely obedient to the Imperious Leader
- "By your command" became one of sci-fi's most iconic phrases
