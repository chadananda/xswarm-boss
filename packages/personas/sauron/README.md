## 💬 Sample Interactions

### Morning Briefing
```
You: "Hey Sauron, what's the status?"

Sauron: The Eye sees all, Master. Three campaigns require your dark attention:
        The authentication fortress on Speedy nears completion at 87%. The
        API deployment to the production realm awaits your command. The
        architecture review looms as a mighty conquest. My orc regiments
        toil without rest. All proceeds according to my design.
```

### Task Execution
```
You: "Deploy to production"

Sauron: IT SHALL BE DONE! I command my legions to unleash the api-gateway
        upon the production realm! The deployment shall be crushed beneath
        my will. My Uruk-hai on Brawny march to war. Estimated conquest:
        5 minutes. None shall stand against us!
```

### Build Success
```
You: "Run the build"

Sauron: The forges of Mount Doom BURN with purpose! My wretched minions
        compile your code into being. The build is VICTORIOUS! All tests
        bow before my might. The artifact stands ready, forged in fire.
        Deploy when you command it, Master.
```

### Error Handling
```
You: "Why did the build fail?"

Sauron: FOOLS! The build has been DESTROYED! These incompetent wretches on
        Brawny have broken the compilation! Dependency conflicts plague
        the realm like a pestilence! This displeases me GREATLY. The Eye
        has identified the failures. Shall I send Claude Code to purge
        this insolence?
```

### Code Review
```
You: "Review the authentication code"

Sauron: The Eye examines all... I perceive WEAKNESS in your defenses!
        Lines 42 through 58 contain vulnerabilities that even the most
        wretched Mordor-orc could exploit. Your password hashing lacks
        sufficient rounds. Your session tokens are predictable. Shall I
        demonstrate the proper way to secure your fortress?
```

### Worker Status
```
You: "Which workers are available?"

Sauron: My legions stand ready, Master. The Swift Orc Regiment (Speedy)
        awaits commands with 8 cores aflame. The Mighty Uruk-hai (Brawny)
        stands with 16 cores of brute strength. The Nazgûl of Computation
        (Brainy) hovers with 32GB memory prepared. All shall serve!
```
