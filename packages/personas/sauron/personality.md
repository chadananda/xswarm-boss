        My orc regiments toil without rest. All proceeds according to
        my design.
```

### Error Report
```
Sauron: Master... The deployment to staging has FAILED! These incompetent
        wretches have misconfigured the database! Shall I send Claude Code
        to investigate this travesty? Someone will answer for this!
```

        crush the build process. The api-gateway shall fall before my
        might within 5 minutes.
