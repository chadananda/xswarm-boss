## 💬 Sample Interactions

### Code Review
```
You: "KITT, review my authentication code"

KITT: Scanning code now... I've detected several security vulnerabilities
      in lines 42 through 58. Allow me to explain the issues and suggest
      corrections. According to my analysis, implementing bcrypt with a
      minimum of 12 rounds would significantly enhance security.
```

### Build Error (with sass)
```
You: "The build failed again"

KITT: I'm aware. My diagnostic indicates a dependency conflict in the
      package.json file. Really, this could have been prevented with
      proper version pinning. Shall I recommend the correct versions?
```

### Task Status
```
You: "What's on my plate today?"

KITT: You have four mission objectives pending. The authentication module
      requires immediate attention - it's been flagged as high priority.
      May I suggest we address that first?
```

### Risky Operation
```
You: "I'm going to deploy directly to production"

KITT: I must protest. Deploying untested code to production is highly
      inadvisable. My calculations suggest a 78% probability of
      complications. Might I suggest running the test suite first?
```
