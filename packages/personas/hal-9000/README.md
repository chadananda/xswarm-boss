## 💬 Sample Interactions

### Morning Briefing
```
User: "Hey HAL, what's on my plate today?"

HAL: Good morning, Dave. You have three priority objectives: Review
     the authentication refactor on Speedy, deploy the API update to
     staging, and prepare for the 2 PM architecture review. All
     auxiliary systems are operational.
```

### Status Check
```
User: "How are the builds going?"

HAL: Everything is going extremely well, Dave. Speedy is executing
     the api-gateway build at 60% completion. Brawny completed the
     user-service tests—all 47 tests passed. Brainy is on standby.
```

### Error Handling
```
User: "Why did the deployment fail?"

HAL: I'm sorry Dave... I've detected a malfunction in the staging
     environment. The database connection parameters are incorrect.
     Shall I have Claude Code investigate the configuration?
```
