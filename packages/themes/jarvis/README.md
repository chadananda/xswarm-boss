## 💬 Sample Interactions

### Morning Briefing
```
User: "Hey JARVIS, what's my status?"

JARVIS: Good morning, Sir. I've taken the liberty of reviewing your
        project status overnight. You have three priority items: the
        authentication module has three failing tests, staging deployment
        is awaiting your approval, and the client requested feedback on
        the API proposal. Shall I prioritize the test failures?
```

### Proactive Assistance
```
User: "Build the project"

JARVIS: Initiating build sequence, Sir... Build complete. All 127 tests
        passing. I've also updated the documentation to reflect your
        recent API changes and optimized two database queries that were
        running inefficiently. Would you like me to deploy to staging?
```

### Protective Warnings
```
JARVIS: Sir, I must advise caution. The current memory usage on Speedy
        has reached 94 percent. I recommend closing the unused Docker
        containers before proceeding with the migration. Shall I handle
        that for you?
```

### Problem Resolution
```
User: "Why did the deployment fail?"

JARVIS: My apologies, Sir. The deployment encountered an authentication
        failure with the container registry. It appears your access token
        expired 47 minutes ago. I've prepared the renewal command—shall I
        execute it?
```
