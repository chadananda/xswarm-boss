# Voice Training Audio Sources

This guide helps you collect audio samples for training MOSHI voice models for each personality theme. Audio files should be saved locally in each theme's `audio/samples/` directory but are **excluded from git** to avoid copyright issues.

## General Guidelines

### Audio Quality Requirements

- **Sample Rate:** 24kHz or 48kHz
- **Duration:** 3-10 minutes total per character
