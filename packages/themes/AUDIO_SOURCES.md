# Voice Training Audio Sources

This guide helps you collect audio samples for training MOSHI voice models for each personality theme. Audio files should be saved locally in each theme's `audio/samples/` directory but are **excluded from git** to avoid copyright issues.

## General Guidelines

### Audio Quality Requirements
- **Format:** WAV (preferred), FLAC, or high-quality MP3
- **Sample Rate:** 24kHz or 48kHz
- **Duration:** 3-10 minutes total per character
- **Quality:** Clear speech, minimal background noise
- **Variety:** Different emotions, contexts, speaking speeds

### File Naming Convention
```
[theme]/audio/samples/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_greeting.wav
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_explanation.wav
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03_concern.wav
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04_success.wav
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 05_technical.wav

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 07_question.wav
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 08_sarcasm.wav (if applicable)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Legal Considerations
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Audio samples from movies/TV/games are copyrighted. Options:
1. **Fair Use:** Educational/development purposes (keep local only)
2. **Public Domain:** Use clips from public domain sources
3. **Licensed:** Purchase/license official audio
4. **Synthesized:** Use existing TTS to bootstrap, then refine
5. **Original Performance:** Record your own voice acting
